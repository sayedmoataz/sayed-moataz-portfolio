Real Estate App Performance Optimization: From 30s to <1s Launch
My role. Lead Mobile Engineer & Performance Specialist

Project description.

I spearheaded the performance overhaul of a high-traffic Real Estate application.

The Challenge: The app suffered from a critical 30-second startup delay due to unoptimized asset loading and API calls, leading to high user churn.

The Solution: I re-architected the startup sequence using parallel asynchronous loading, implemented lazy initialization, and optimized the local caching layer.

The Result: Reduced launch time to under 1 second and improved overall UI responsiveness by 40%. This solution was so successful it became the basis for an open-source Flutter package I authored.
